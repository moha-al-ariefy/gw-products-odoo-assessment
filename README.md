# GW Products - Odoo Front-End Developer Test

## Objective
The structure plan and code structure for the real-time sales analytics dashboard assignment can be located in this repository.

## Approach
The goal was not to provide a finished working module in the time limit, but to demonstrate a senior-level approach to front-end development in the context of the Odoo environment.

The solution focuses on:
- **Reactivity:** Using OWL's core hooks for a reactive user interface.
- **Resilience:** An offline-first design to render the dashboard 'always-on'.
- **Scalability:** A minimalist, modular component tree and an efficient, secure data pipeline.

## Mentioned Technologies
- Odoo 18 / OWL Framework
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- QWeb Templating
- IndexedDB for offline caching
- Odoo's RPC & Bus Service for real-time messaging
